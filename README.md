# CartesianGraphCalculator
The Cartesian Graph Calculator implements three types of cartesian one dimensional structures, namely, P-structure, C-structure and K-structure; and nine combinations of PCK structures, namely, ((Pm x Pn), (Pm x Cn), (Pm x Kn), (Cm x Pn), (Cm x Cn), (Cm x Kn), (Km x Pn), (Km x Cn) and (Km x Kn). The software developed is intended to serve the graph mathematicians to explore the behavior of PCK graphs for different labeling of the nodes with predefined pattern of self-weights.
